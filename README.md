This is Sudoku game with 3 difficulty levels. The algorithm creates a list of numbers from 1 to 9 and shuffles this list. Then, a two-dimensional array is filled with values from the list, with a shift of 3 positions in each subsequent row. After the array is fully populated, the columns and rows are swapped. Before displaying the data from the array on the board, the algorithm performs a check to verify is the values' arrangement  in the array is correct.
Finally, the values from the array are displayed on the board with random empty cells for filling. When a value is entered into these cells, the algorithm compares the entered value with the corresponding value in the array.
